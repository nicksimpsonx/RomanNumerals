# RomanNumerals
A TDD implementation of the roman numerals calculator kata

This is my first attempt at the roman numeral coding kata, I decided to do this on one of our learn tech afternoons at <b>MadeTech</b> where we are lucky enough to be able to devote half a day every week to learning cool new things... Also I have just installed intellij and I wanted to do something to get used to it having used eclipse forever.  

The objective is to be able to accept a string and convert the string into it's decimal equivalent. I wanted to do this because a friend of mine told me that he was given this kata to do in a job interview and found it tricky, I was interested to see whether using a TDD approach would help with creating a nice algorithm. This is what I ended up with after about an hour.

## Author
This implementation was programmed by <b>Nicholas Simpson</b> in January 2021

## How to use
There is no main method in this program so you can either include it as part of your project, new up an instance of the RomanCalculator and call it's evaluate method or just load it in your IDE of choice and run the tests or do a maven clean install from your terminal to see the test output.
